Small 42-key mechanical keyboard with ISO layout (french)

This project aims to create a minimalist mechanical keyboard from scratch. It will therefore include all the 3D files and various pcb related files.

## Renders

As this keyboard is in a "pre-project" state, some renders have been made to evaluate the feasability and the arrangement of the keys.

## Layout

The physical layout of the keyboard presents 42 keys that are compatible with most of keycaps sets.

The different layers of the keyboard still remain unknown at the moment...

## PCB

The PCB requires SMD components, the list of all electronic parts is presented below:
