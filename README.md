__Or "How to fit a french ISO layout in a 40% keyboard ?__

This project aims to create a minimalist mechanical keyboard from scratch. It will therefore include all the 3D files and various pcb related files to conduct the project.

## Renders

To get a better glimpse of the project, some renders have been done. They can give a good approximation of the end result product and are therefore a precious help for tweaking parameters.

## Layout

The physical layout of the keyboard presents 42 keys that are compatible with most of keycaps sets.

The different layers of the keyboard still remain unknown at the moment...

## PCB

The 3D view of the PCB looks like this:
