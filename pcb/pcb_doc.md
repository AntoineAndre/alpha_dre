Even if the design is planed to be sandwich mounted with a stack of acrylic plate, the PCB design offers the possibily to go for a trail mount. 

## Part list

The PCB has been designed to be soldered with SMD components and therefore needs a lot of different electronic parts. The list is presented below with the links to the [LCSC](https://lcsc.com/) components:
