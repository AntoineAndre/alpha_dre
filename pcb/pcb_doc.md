Even if the design is planed to be sandwich mounted with a stack of acrylic plate, the PCB design offers the possibily to go for a trail mount with dedicated M3 holes (5 evenly spaced on the PCB).

## Part list

The PCB has been designed to be soldered with SMD components and therefore needs a lot of different electronic parts that are listed below:
